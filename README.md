Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique used to identify the sentiment expressed in text. It follows a workflow involving data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, sentiment classification using rule-based, machine learning, or deep learning models, model evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Techniques such as rule-based methods, machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, lexicon-based approaches, and hybrid methods can be employed. Considerations for implementation include ensuring data quality, applying appropriate preprocessing techniques, selecting suitable feature representations (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings), choosing the right model architecture, evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score, and continuously improving the system based on feedback and monitoring. Sentiment analysis has applications in social media analysis, customer feedback analysis, brand management, and market research.
